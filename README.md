# Air-Quality-in-Nairobi
Projects Submitted for World Quant University - Applied Data Science Lab using Python. In this project, data was mined from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. The air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam was used to build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Overview

In this project, you'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. You'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time seriesmodel to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
How to prepare time series data for analysis.
How to build an autoregression model.
How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.

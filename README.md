# Air-Quality-in-Nairobi
Projects Submitted for World Quant University - Applied Data Science Lab using Python. In this project, data was mined from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. The air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam was used to build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.
